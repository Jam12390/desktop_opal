# Desktop Opal

A flutter app based off the iOS app Opal which aims to help you get work done without distractions!

**NOTE: I am aware that there is no build for this. No matter what I did flutter would not build the windows version correctly so I've resorted to just uploading the source code.**

## Overview

Desktop Opal (DO) is my personal version of the iOS app Opal which I made as I couldn't find any screen time management apps for windows which I liked. DO uses a flutter UI to interact with a python API backend using the winreg module to manage the DisallowRun key in the windows registry. Since that was a mouthful, it boils down to Flutter UI frontend --> Python API --> Windows Registry Management. The python API runs on port 8000 of the callback IP 127.0.0.1 and listens for post and get requests from the flutter UI.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èWarnings

- Before entering a block session, close all apps which are going to be blocked since those that are open will be force quit.
- While inside a block session, don't close the app OR the API, this will lock you out of any apps you blocked during that session.
- Don't be dumb (i.e. Don't block any system processes).

## üóíÔ∏èPrerequisites
Desktop_Opal requires:
- Admin permission on launch to access and edit winreg.

## üîΩInstallation
- Download and extract the ShipReleasev1.0 folder from releases.
- Run desktop_opal.

## ‚ùìHow To Use (if you haven't looked at settings yet)
Blocking Apps:
The block now button will open a prompt to select how long you want to block your apps for. These apps can be found in settings under blocked apps.
Apps which have a tick next to them will be blocked during a session, anything else will be ignored.
There will be a dropdown menu asking what duration type you want, fixed duration has options such as 5mins, 10mins, etc. whereas until xx:xx will have you choose a time you want your apps blocked until.
The breaks allowed checkbox is self-explanatory, if the box is unticked the take a break button won't work.

Breaks:
During a block session, the block now button will turn into the take a break button.
Pressing this will open a dialog (if breaks are allowed) asking how long you want to take a break for (default = 5mins).
Pressing ok will start the break while end block session will end your session prematurely.
During a break, there will be a continue blocking button, pressing this will end your break immediately.

Editing Included Programs:
In the settings tab there are 3 main buttons regarding adding executables to the blocked apps list.
Auto-Detect Executables:
This scans the desktop for shortcuts and extracts their target files, adding them to the block list.
Delete All Entries (Reset):
This wipes the DisallowRun key and blocked apps list.
Edit Apps:
Opens a dialog giving more options for editing the blocked apps list.
In this dialog you can:
- Delete specific entries
- Hide and show entries
- Manually add executables to the blockedApps list

# ‚ùîFAQ

**NOTE: Almost all of this is covered in the how to use section of settings. This is here in case of future updates.**

**Help! All of my apps are still blocked even after my session has ended!**

This is fine and probably happened because the app or API closed during a block session. The uhoh button in settings *should* fix this however if it doesn't:
- Press windows+R and type in regedit
- Go to this path: SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS\\CURRENTVERSION\\POLICIES\\EXPLORER\\DISALLOWRUN
- Either:
- Delete ALL subkeys except (default)
- OR Delete the DisallowRun key entirely (the program should recreate this key on startup - if it doesn't, manually create it again at this path)

**What's this python window that's showing up?**

Thats the API window, do not close it until you leave the app. Closing the python window will terminate the API and prevent any further interaction from the app with the windows registry.

**Why did this take you 53 hours?**

I don't know. It shouldn't have taken me this long, however I can think of a few reasons as to why:
- This is my first time using flutter for a full project.
- I hadn't used 75% of the packages I used prior to this project.
- This was my first time trying hybrid programming.
- I'm generally a slow worker (and went into this blind leading to me wasting like 10 hours on a weird layout).
